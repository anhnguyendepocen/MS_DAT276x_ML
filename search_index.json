The labs are graded, and you will be required to answer questions after each lab to verify that you have completed them successfully. Programming Languages Used in this Course Many of the labs involve writing code in R. This course does not attempt to teach you exhaustive programming skills and syntax in these languages, so any experience you may already have in either language will be useful. However, the labs and demonstrations will provide you with the code you need to perform the data science operations described in this course, even if you have no prior experience, and there are references to resources that will help you work with these languages. Platform Requirements To execute the labs for this course you will need a computer meeting the following minimum requirements At least 10GB of free disk space. At least 8 GB of RAM. Running Windows, MAC OS X, or Linux. Installing Software for the Labs If you do not already have an environment capable of running a Jupyter notebook with an R kernel, follow the steps below. Anaconda stack: Installing Anaconda is one of the easiest ways to install Jupyter notebooks. Download the Python 3.X version for your operating system from the Anaconda download page. R: Download and install the latest version of R from the Comprehensive R Archive Network Jupyter R Kernel: In order to run R in Jupyter you must download the Jupyter IRkernel. Follow the directions carefully. You can run a simple R session required for this installation by starting R and using the console. If this is the first time you have installed R you will need to run the command options(repos = “https://CRAN.R-project.org”) before you can install R packages, including the IRKernel. Important note for MAC users Note the warning that you must run the commands in step 2 in a command console, not from R Lab Materials From the Course Repository: You can download the Zip file with the course lab materials from the course Github repository. Click on the Clone or download tab, and selected Download Zip. If you have Git installed, you can clone this repository. Install R packages: You can install the R packages you will require for the labs by executing the code in the Setup notebook. Note: If you experience continual Jupyter kernel restarts, you may need to reinstall the R Rcpp package by executing the install.packages(“Rcpp”) command from the R console "],

You may not always need all the stages. Data science is an iterative process. - Backwards arrows on most process diagrams. 1.1.3 Example of the knowledge discovery process I’ll walk you through the knowledge discovery process with an example - the process of predicting power failures in Manhattan. Motivation for Example In NYC the peak demand for electricity is rising. The infrastructure dates back to the 1880’s from the time of Thomas Edison. Power failures occur fairly often (enough to do statistic) and are expensive to repair We want to determine how to prioritize manhole inspections in order to reduce the number of manhole events (fires, explosions, outages) in the future. This is a real problem. Stagse in the knowledge discovery procss Opportunity Assessment &amp; Business Understanding Data Understanding &amp; Data Acquisition Data Preparation, including Cleaning and Transformation Model Building Policy Construciton Evaluation, Residuals and Metrics Model Deployment, Monitoring, Model Updates Opportunity Assessment &amp; Business Understanding What do you really want to accomplish and what are the constraints? What are the risks? How will you evaluate the quality of the results? For manhole events the general goal was to “Predict manhole fires and explosions before they occur.” We made it ore precise: Goal 1: Assess predictive accuracy for predicting manhole events in the uear before they happen. Goal 2: Create a cost-benefit analysis for inspection policies that takes into account the cost of inspections and manhole fires. Determine how often manholes need to be inspected. 1.2 Overview of Machine Learning with K-Means Classifiers "],
